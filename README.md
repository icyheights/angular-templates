Templates for AngularJS component-based development

Complete explanation of this approach to Angular application design is yet to be done.

## Quickstart:


* `gulp directive` - make directive component and its testing environment 
* `gulp service` - make service component 
* `gulp filter` - make filter component

`gulp-test-task.js` in src contains template task for building directive test page
